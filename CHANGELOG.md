## v0.10.0

This is just a cleanup commit.\
The second version number is bumped since version v0.9.0 says v0.10.0 will
start the changelog.

- (docs) **Start the changelog**
- (docs) Removed extra words in the readme's silly dependency note.
- (tests) `Sudoku.test.tsx`: Remove unused stuff
- (tests) `Sudoku.test.tsx`: Test manually toggling all the candidates in
addition to pressing <kbd>Backspace</kbd>
- (code) Remove 2 `Sudoku` methods, which both (!?) get a `Cell` *instance*.\
These methods aren't actually used anywhere
