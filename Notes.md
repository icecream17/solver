# Notes

1. `setState` updates asynchronously
    1. If you need the _latest_ state, use a callback instead of an object
    1. Or for setting state based on previous state
1. Backspace/Delete(/Clear) deletes all the candidates
1. Shift+\<Delete> just resets a cell
1. Using IDs to identify elements since that's what IDs are for
1. Current IDs:
    1. `Aside` in `App`
    1. `Data` in `App > Main`
