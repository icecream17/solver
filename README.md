# solver

A simple sudoku solver I made.

## Silly dependency note

This projects uses the latest versions of its dependencies, but those dependencies themselves aren't updated.

In particular, the dependency `react-scripts` depends on outdated versions of `postcss` in 80 different ways. The only reason I know about this is because of `npm audit` which shows security vulnerabilities.
