# Strategies

## Explanations

These strategies are probably better explained elsewhere.

I am not attempting to explain these strategies as much as document them.

### CheckForSolved

This succeeds if there are new solved digits ("big digits").

Also used to check if the sudoku is invalid, like having 0 fours in a column,
or 7 threes in a box.

### UpdateCandidates

For each solved digit, say "3", that digit cannot appear again in the same row, column, or box.

So any candidate "3"s there are eliminated

### Pairs, triples, and quads

> N candidates appear in N cells which are in the same row/column/box, so in the rest of that row/column/box, those N candidates are eliminated

It's impossible for N cells to only have N-1 candidates.

Therefore, any candidate that causes the N cells to have N-1 candidates can be removed.

This is actually more general than the implementation, since the implementation checks for candidates that see *all N cells*.\
That isn't necessarily the case, like in this example:

```rust
1234 1234 .... | 48
123  123  .... |
.... .... .... |
---------------+

// (4 can be removed from A4 [row 1 column 4])
```

The reason why it's called "Pairs, triples, and quads" is because this strategy specifically searches for N cells having N candidates, e.g. 2 cells requiring 2 candidates, or 3 cells requiring 3 candidates, etc.\
So pairs, triples, and quads.

```rust
12 12 // Pair, eliminates "1" and "2" from any cells seeing the whole pair.
12 23 31 // Triple, eliminates "1", "2", and "3"
12 23 34 41 // Quad, of 1234
```

But theoretically, a strategy could include conjugates where N cells require N+1 or even N+2 candidates.

```rust
12345 12345 ..... | 45... 456..
..... 123.. 123.. |
..... ..... ..... |
------------------+

// Here, A5 must be 6
// Why? Well, if A5 was anything else, there would be a 45 pair with A4/A5
// This would eliminate both 4 and 5 from the conjugate of 4 cells in box 1
// And now those 4 cells (with 5 candidates) only have 3 candidates


// Actually here's an N+2 example

123456 123456 ...... | 456... 456... 4567..
...... 123... 123... |
...... ...... ...... |
---------------------+

// Same logic, if A6 is not 7, the resulting 456 triple would cause
// 4 cells to only have 123.
```

EDIT: This strategy is called Sue-De-Coq

Thanks to PixelPlucker from discord:

```md
r1c1 and r1c2 can contain at most one digit from the 123 triple and at most one digit from the 456 triple, completing them both. So {123} can be removed from the rest of the box, and {456} from the rest of the row
```

```md
No need to credit, Iâ€™m definitely not the first person to describe SDCs this way :laughing:
```

### Hidden pairs, triples, and quads

Instead of N cells needing N candidates, N candidates must be in N cells.
So the rest of the candidates in those *cells* are eliminated.

```rust
123456789 ...456789 ...456789
123456789 ...456789 ...456789
123456789 ...456789 ...456789
```

1, 2, and 3 have to be in the 3 leftmost cells... so

```rust
123...... ...456789 ...456789
123...... ...456789 ...456789
123...... ...456789 ...456789
```

### X wing, Swordfish, and Jellyfish

Consider the rule that each (row, column, and box)... each group must have all digits 1-9.

So how many 7s does one group have?

Each group has one 7.

So n non-intersecting groups have n of every candidate.

And notice how if 3 rows have 3 sevens, those 3 sevens must also appear in 3 columns!

So if you manage to limit n rows to n columns, the rest of those columns cannot have that candidate!

```rust
A..A..A..
e  e  e
e  e  e
A..A..A..
e  e  e
e  e  e
A..A..A..
e  e  e
e  e  e

// So for example, these 3 rows have 3 "A"
// ...which are all only 3 columns. So the 3 "A" in the 3 rows must be in the 3 columns
// Therefore, the 3 columns must only have "A" in the 3 rows

// 3 rows only in 3 columns -->
//    3 columns only in 3 rows
```

> Also
> n lines - n-1 lines = 1 line
> If all of that 1 line sees a candidate, that candidate can be removed.

Just see Hodoku's page on Basic Fish

Basically, 3 lines only appears in 3 crosslines = the rest of the crosslines can be eliminated

Now how do you detect this in code?

A naive way is to do this:

```rust
loop: for row in rows
  loop: for row2 in rows
    loop: for row3 in rows
      loop: for row4 in rows
        if onlyInFourColumns(row, row2, row3, row4):
          success!

// and same for the columns
```

But that's obviously inefficient. An improvement would be:

```rust
loop: for row in rows
  loop: for row2 in restOfRows
    loop: for row3 in restOfRestOfRows
      loop: for row4 in restOfRestOfRows
```

But notice that if `rows = [1, 2]`...

```rust
row: 1, row2: 2
row: 2, row2: 1
```

So instead, we eliminate the loops altogether,
and track what rows were added to the pattern.

That way, `row` --> row1 then row2 then row3 then row4....
  (goes in order)
instead of `row` and `row2`
  (not in order)

```rust
total1 // [row]
total2 // [row, row2]
total3 // [row, row2, row3]
total4 // [row, row2, row3, row4]
for row in rows:
  update(row, total3, total4)
  update(row, total2, total3)
  update(row, total1, total2)
  check(total4)

fn update(row, total_n, total_n_plus_1):
  for group in total_n:
    add([row, ...group]).to(total_n_plus_1)

// Where the following is equivalent:
// total1 --> total1 + row
// [row, row2, row3] --> [[row + row], [row + row2], [row + row3]]
```

"Why not just do..."

```rust
loop: for row in rows
  loop: for row2 in greaterRows
    loop: for row3 in greaterGreaterRows
      loop: for row4 in greaterGreaterGreaterRows
```

Well... oh yeah. But whatever, I already wrote the function...

```rust
// 9 combinations * (time(3 * num_group * group.length) + check)
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9

// 126 items (126 = 9 * 14) * check
1234
1235
1236
1237
1238
1239
```

### Skyscraper

This is just an x-wing disjointed on one line.

Or you could say that 2 lines - 1 crossline means the extra has at least 1

```rust
. e e | A . .
A . . | . e e
. . . | . . .
------+-------
A . . | A . .
```

The reason this is so easy is because

1. Simpler than a finned/sashimi x wing. (No groups!)
2. It's super similar to an x wing.\
   In fact, one of the lines stay the same.

It's just below "x wing" is the strategy list below.

### Two string kite

```rust
   A2    |   B2
A1       |
---------+------
B1       |   e

// A row and column share at box
// So either B1 or B2, so not e
```

### Y wing / XY wing / Bent triple

```rust
AB  BC
    n
    n
-------
n   AC
n
n

// Whatever BC is, either AB or AC will have A
// So A can be eliminated at n
```

### Two minus one lines

If you have 2 lines, and remove 1 crossline, the remainder must have at least 1 of \[unmentioned specific candidate].

So anything that sees *all* of the extras can be eliminated

```rust
// Example
  E E | C
e     |
e     |
------+--
E     | C

```

This happens to be equivalent to sashimi/finned x wing, but with 3 lines it's more general.

### XY Loop

See <https://youtu.be/OUKwjVs4MsY> for an explanation of an XY Loop.

It's basically an XY Chain, where both ends connect:

```rust
12 23
   34 45
--------
      56
61
```

You can color these candidates A or B, and any candidate seeing both A and B can be eliminated

```rust
12 23 a
b  34 45
--------
c  d  56
61 e  f

// 1 is eliminated from b and c
// 2 is eliminated from a and b
// 3 is eliminated from a, b, d, and e
// 4 is eliminated from a and b
// 5 is eliminated from a and f
// 6 is eliminated from c, d, e, and f
```

My implementation just so happens to not care if the last cell is connected to the first:

```rust
12 23    | (not 1)
   34 45 |
---------+---
      56 | 61
```

Which just so happens to implement XY Chain.

XY Chain (see <https://www.sudokuwiki.org/XY_Chains>) is a strategy which proves that some candidate, in this case 1, must appear on at least one end of the chain.

So wow!

Edit: See XY Chain

## XY Chain

About that XY Loop stuff... yeah, XY Chain is special enough to get it's own function now.

## TODO

Here's a list of a bunch of strategies, with somewhat of a difficulty spectrum.

Many strategies are more well known, but that doesn't change anything here - this is based on intrinsic difficulty.

"Has dual" just notes that it can happen twice with an almost similar setup (e.g. same base or something)

A lot of this strategy ranking is me guessing.

- [x] 1. Check for solved
  - n
- [x] 2. Hidden singles
  - n^3 (n for each candidate, n for each group, n for each cell in group (checking single))
  - Easier than update candidates because humans
  - Despite this, hidden singles doesn't work if the candidates are not updated
- [x] 3. Update candidates
  - n^3 (n for each cell, n for each affects(cell), n for checking if affects(cell) contains that solved candidate)
- [x] 4. Intersection Removal
  - All candidates in a box see OR All candidates in a line see
  - n^4 (n for each candidate, n^2 for box + line, n for each cell in (box - line) or (line - box))
- [x] =5. Pairs, triples, and quads
  - N cells have N candidates (and all see each other)
  - n^5 (I have no idea how I did this. My code is quite big)
- [x] =5. Hidden pairs, triples, and quads
  - N candidates are in N cells (which all see each other)
  - n^5 (Pretty much the same as the non hidden strategy.)
- [x] 7. X wing (really a fish)
  - 2 lines have a candidate in only 2 crosslines
  - n^6 (see {fish note})
- [x] 8. Skyscraper (Subset of wing/coloring)
  - 2 lines - 1 line = extra
  - n^6 ({fish note} - but instead I spend n^3 * {n counting pend lines, n^3 to get attacks(cell of line), n^3 per attacks to get shared} = n^6)
- [x] 9. Swordfish
  - 3 lines have a candidate in only 3 crosslines
  - n^6 (see {fish note})
- [x] 10. Jellyfish
  - 4 lines have a candidate in only 4 crosslines
  - n^6 (see {fish note})

## Ideas

### Finned/Sashimi Fish

Say there's *n* rows in this fish. And you take away the candidates in *n-1* columns.

At most, *n-1* candidates from those *n* rows are in those *n-1* columns.

So, at least *1* of the remaining candidates in those *n* rows must be true!

Therefore, any candidate seeing all of those remaining candidates must be false!

```rust
C     | C     | A A A
      |       | e e e
C     | C     | A A A
------+-------+------
C     | C     |

// Here's an example with the 1st, 3rd, and 4th rows
// There are 3 rows, but at *most* there's 2 occurances in the *c* region
// Therefore, the A region must have at least 1 occurance.
// So such candidate could be eliminated from the *e* region

C     | C     | A
      |       |     e
C     | C     | 1 2
------+-------+------
C     | C     |     A
      |       | e
      |       | e

// Here's another example, where the extra cells than an different boxes
// I labeled such extra cells "attackers" represented with a capital A
// If there was an attacker at "1", nothing would change!
// But at "2", only the single elimination in box 3 applies.

C     | C     | A A A
e     | e     | e e e
C     | C     | A A A
------+-------+------
C     | C     |
e     | e     |
e     | e     |
------+-------+------
e     | e     |
e     | e     |
e     | e     |

// Notice that in the first example, there can be *at most* 1 occurance in the *a* region
// Therefore the *c* region must have 2 occurances!
// So actually there's more eliminations!

// Note:
// In the second example it's possible for the *c* region to only have 1 occurance.
// So it's not possible there

// Try finding it! Easy example:
// 012037000000000800000000000067051040000000000000000000045012009000000000000000000
```

### Wow

```rust
A     |   E   | B
  B   |   E   |   A
E E E |   e   | E E E
------+-------+------
  N   |   E   | A
N     |   E   |   B
      |       |

// "e" is eliminated since if all "E" was removed there would be an invalid loop
// Not sure how this could be detected

   | 999 |
89 | 789 | e
---+-----+---
n9 | 79  | 99999999999

// Say column 1 only has two possible 9s
// Column 2 can have any amount of 9s. Also the rows as well

// n9 is linked to 789 because of the 89 and 79
// e cannot be 9
```

### Combinations of almost fishes

```rust
// Idea when looking at https://youtu.be/OUKwjVs4MsY

56 6 | 58 | 8
   6 | 58 | 8 56

// Pretend all of these cells have way more digits
// However, in these two rows, 5, 6, and 8 are restricted...

// We can color the eights with A and B
56 6 | 5B | A
   6 | 5A | B 56

// Next we can color the fives with C and D, where A <> C and B <> D
C6 6 | DB | A
   6 | CA | B D6

// And finally the sixes
CE F | DB | A
   E | CA | B DF

// Tada! We have proved that in column 2, six must either be at F or E

// Of course, in the actual sudoku the same relation can be proved like this:
67 | 78
---+---
69 | 89

// If top left = 7, top right = 8, bottom right = 9, bottom left = 6
// In fact this is an XY Ring
// Kinda of like XY Chain but it's a Loop
```

### Substrat of Aligned Pair Exclusion

```rust
23   24   25  | 234567 e     e
              | 26     27

// This example is a UVWXYZ-Wing
```

## Exocet

See my comment ("Steven" on 7-AUG-2021) <https://www.sudokuwiki.org/Exocet>

Also this double exocet is impossible:

```rust
AB AB    |        |   AB AB
      T  |        | T
         | T      |

// However, if the double exocet base cells had "1234"
// and everything fits...

// ...except that 4 has 3 coverlines....
// That means, one of the base cells = 4 = invalid
// And the rest correspond to targets
```

### Terrible

You know about Pattern Overlay?

It's exhausting to try all the combinations for 1 number! Ugh!

But... by trying the combinations... of the combinations for each digit,
the puzzle is guaranteed to be solved.

I wonder if this strategy can be simplified

### EstablishLink

This would establish a (nontrivial) link between two candidates.

Which could make the linking strategies more powerful.

Currently I have no linking strategies but when/if I do, this will be in mind.

### "I would call that an Almost Locked Triple"

There's also an "Almost Locked Pair".
The first actual results are here: <http://forum.enjoysudoku.com/help-almost-locked-candidates-move-t37339.html>

And also "Dual almost locked pair/triple"!???
